        <h2><a href="/posts/board-friend/">The Board Is Not Your Enemy, Unless You Make It One</a></h2>
        <p class="post-description">Boards don't become adversarial by default. They become adversarial when founders avoid structure and force governance to emerge through intervention instead of design.</p>

        <h2><a href="/posts/builder-hustler-operator/">The Myth of 'Build It and They Will Come'</a></h2>

        <h2><a href="/posts/founders-struggle-let-go/">Why Founders Struggle With Letting Go</a></h2>

        <h2><a href="/posts/startups-fail-lack-vision/">Startups Don’t Fail from Lack of Vision; They Fail from Lack of Structure</a></h2>
