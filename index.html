        <h2><a href="/posts/board-friend/">The Board Is Not Your Enemy, Unless You Make It One</a></h2>
        <p class="post-description">Boards don't become adversarial by default. They become adversarial when founders avoid structure and force governance to emerge through intervention instead of design.</p>

        <h2><a href="/posts/bizdev-breaks-struct/">When Structure Fails, Conflict Fills the Gap</a></h2>
        <p class="post-description">Most conflicts between technical leadership and business development aren't personality clashes. They're structural failures caused by unclear authority, blurred domains, and leaders who won't respect boundaries.</p>

        <p class="post-description">ESOPs get sold as part of your compensation, but structurally they're not pay. They're discretionary, illiquid side-bets that shift risk onto employees without giving them real value or power.</p>

        <h2><a href="/posts/founders-struggle-let-go/">Why Founders Struggle With Letting Go</a></h2>
        <p class="post-description">Founders often believe their personal involvement is what keeps the company alive. That may be true early on, but it becomes the bottleneck that stops the organisation from maturing. Letting go isn’t emotional; it’s structural.</p>

        <h2><a href="/posts/tech-debt-not-tech/">The Cost of Technical Debt Isn’t Technical</a></h2>
        <p class="post-description">Technical debt shows up in code, but its real impact is on how people work, think, and interact. The cost is paid in trust, morale, and predictability long before anyone starts refactoring.</p>

        <p class="post-description">Most startups don’t die because they lack big ideas. They die because they never build the structure needed to turn those ideas into reality.</p>
